# Middleware Module

## Overview
The Middleware module serves as a central hub for managing and enhancing the functionality of the FastAPI backend. It includes custom middleware implementations for authentication, authorization, logging, and LangChain integration. These components ensure that the system is secure, well-monitored, and optimized for AI-driven workflows.

---

## Features
1. **Authentication**:
   - Ensures only valid users or agents can access protected endpoints.
   - Supports token-based authentication using standards like OAuth2.

2. **Authorization**:
   - Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user actions based on permissions.

3. **Logging**:
   - Provides centralized logging for all incoming requests, outgoing responses, and errors.
   - Ensures consistent monitoring and debugging across the application.

4. **LangChain Middleware**:
   - Facilitates seamless integration of LangChain for advanced AI workflows.
   - Manages the preprocessing and postprocessing of LangChain-powered tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automatedbureaucracy.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Enable middleware in your FastAPI application:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from middleware.auth.authentication import authenticate_user
   from middleware.logging.logging_middleware import LoggingMiddleware

   app = FastAPI()

   # Add middleware
   app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)

   # Example route
   @app.get("/secure-endpoint")
   async def secure_endpoint(token: str = Depends(authenticate_user)):
       return {"message": "Access granted!"}
   ```

## Middleware Components

### Authentication
- Validates user credentials and tokens.
- Implements security best practices, such as token expiration and renewal.

### Authorization
- Enforces RBAC to restrict actions based on roles and permissions.

### Logging
- Captures all HTTP interactions with the server.
- Logs error details, including stack traces, for debugging purposes.

### LangChain Middleware
- Prepares requests for LangChain processing.
- Manages AI-driven workflows, enabling tasks like summarization, Q&A, and retrieval.

## Example Log Output

**Request Log**:
```plaintext
2025-01-25 21:20:00 - INFO - Incoming request: POST /tasks/execute
2025-01-25 21:20:00 - INFO - Headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer xyz123', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
```

**Response Log**:
```plaintext
2025-01-25 21:20:01 - INFO - Outgoing response: 200 - Process time: 0.45 seconds
2025-01-25 21:20:01 - INFO - Response headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'}
```

**Error Log**:
```plaintext
2025-01-25 21:21:00 - ERROR - Error during request processing: KeyError: 'missing_field'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 50, in process_request
    value = data['missing_field']
```

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Distributed Middleware**:
   - Add support for distributed tracing across microservices.

2. **Adaptive Middleware**:
   - Dynamically enable or disable middleware based on configuration.

3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Integrate with ELK Stack or Datadog for advanced analytics.
