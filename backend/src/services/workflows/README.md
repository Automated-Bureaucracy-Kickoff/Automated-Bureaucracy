# Workflow Services

The Workflow Services module provides functionality to manage, monitor, and validate workflows within the Automated Bureaucracy system. This includes managing approval pipelines, ensuring compliance with defined rules, and facilitating document parsing for workflow-related tasks.


---

## Overview

The Workflow Services module is a critical component of the backend system. It ensures that workflows and tasks comply with organizational rules and regulations while providing the flexibility to define and enforce custom logic for approval processes.

### Key Goals:
- Automate compliance checks and approvals.
- Ensure accountability with robust logging and reporting.
- Provide modular, extensible components for workflow management.

---

## Features

1. **Approval Management**:
   - Define and manage approval pipelines for workflows.
   - Automate decision-making using configurable rules.

2. **Compliance Validation**:
   - Validate workflows and tasks against predefined compliance rules.
   - Generate detailed compliance reports for auditing purposes.

3. **Document Parsing**:
   - Extract and process information from documents within workflows.

4. **Customizability**:
   - Easily extend the services to include custom approval logic or compliance rules.

## Modules

### Approval Service

The `approval_service.py` module provides functionality to handle approval pipelines for workflows. This includes:
- Managing workflow states and approvals.
- Automating approval decisions based on predefined rules or thresholds.

### Compliance Service

The `compliance_service.py` module handles compliance-related tasks such as:
- Registering and validating compliance rules.
- Logging compliance checks for auditing.
- Generating compliance reports.

## Usage Examples

### Approval Service Example

```python
from services.workflows.approval_service import ApprovalService

# Initialize the approval service
approval_service = ApprovalService()

# Create a workflow
workflow_id = approval_service.create_workflow(owner="alice", description="Quarterly budget approval")

# Approve the workflow
approval_service.approve_workflow(workflow_id, approver="bob")
```

### Compliance Service Example

```python
from services.workflows.compliance_service import ComplianceService

# Initialize the compliance service
compliance_service = ComplianceService()

# Add compliance rules
compliance_service.add_rule(
    rule_id="rule001",
    description="Task must have a valid description.",
    validation_function=lambda task: bool(task.get("description"))
)

# Check compliance
task_details = {"description": "Budget approval task", "owner": "alice"}
results = compliance_service.check_compliance(task_details)
print("Compliance Results:", results)
```

## Extensibility

The Workflow Services module is designed with extensibility in mind. Developers can:
- Add custom rules and validation logic to the Compliance Service.
- Extend the Approval Service to include new pipeline states or conditions.
- Integrate with additional document processing tools for workflow-related tasks.
