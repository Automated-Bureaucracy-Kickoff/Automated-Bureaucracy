# Services

The **Services** module is a core component of the Automated Bureaucracy system. It provides business logic and operational capabilities for managing workflows, documents, and compliance-related tasks. This module acts as the backend's functional layer, ensuring seamless interactions between the system's middleware and analytics components.


---

## Overview

The **Services** module encapsulates key functionalities necessary for the operational integrity of the system. It bridges high-level business logic with lower-level services, offering reusable, modular components to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Key Goals:
- Centralize and standardize service logic.
- Maintain modularity for easy extensibility.
- Provide robust APIs for seamless integration with other backend components.

---

## Features

1. **Workflow Management**:
   - Automate and streamline workflow creation, approval, and monitoring.
   - Integrate compliance checks directly into workflows.

2. **Document Services**:
   - Manage document processing, parsing, and metadata extraction.
   - Enforce document-level access controls.

3. **Compliance and Approvals**:
   - Validate workflows and documents against custom compliance rules.
   - Provide flexible approval pipelines for workflow tasks.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Modular services that can be easily extended to support additional features.

## Submodules

### Documents

The **Documents** submodule handles document-related operations. It provides:
- Document metadata management.
- Parsing capabilities for structured and unstructured data.
- Integration with access control policies.

Refer to the [Documents README](documents/README.md) for more details.

### Workflows

The **Workflows** submodule provides capabilities for managing workflows, including:
- Approval pipelines for tasks.
- Compliance validation for workflows.
- Detailed logging for audits and monitoring.

Refer to the [Workflows README](workflows/README.md) for more details.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Workflow with Approvals

```python
from services.workflows.approval_service import ApprovalService

# Initialize the approval service
approval_service = ApprovalService()

# Create a workflow
workflow_id = approval_service.create_workflow(owner="john", description="Annual report review")

# Approve the workflow
approval_service.approve_workflow(workflow_id, approver="mary")
```

### Processing a Document

```python
from services.documents.document_service import DocumentService

# Initialize the document service
document_service = DocumentService()

# Parse a document
parsed_data = document_service.parse_document("sample_report.pdf")
print("Parsed Data:", parsed_data)
```

---

## Extensibility

The **Services** module is designed to be extensible:
- Add new approval logic to workflows.
- Introduce custom compliance validation rules.
- Extend document parsing capabilities with additional processing tools.

Developers can leverage this flexibility to meet specific business requirements without affecting existing functionality.
