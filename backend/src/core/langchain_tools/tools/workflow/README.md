# Workflow Tools

The `workflow` module within the `langchain_tools` directory provides a suite of tools for managing and automating workflows in the system. These tools enable the approval, compliance checking, and document parsing processes to be seamlessly integrated into LangChain-based workflows, ensuring that tasks can be executed efficiently and with traceable compliance.

---

## Tools Overview

### 1. **Approval Pipeline Tool**
   - **File**: `approval_pipeline_tool.py`
   - **Purpose**: Automates the process of routing tasks for approvals across various stakeholders.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Define custom approval pipelines.
     - Track the progress of approvals.
     - Integrates with LangChain workflows for dynamic task assignment.

### 2. **Compliance Checker Tool**
   - **File**: `compliance_checker_tool.py`
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that tasks, workflows, and documents comply with predefined compliance rules.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Validate compliance rules against workflow logs and agent outputs.
     - Supports custom rule definitions.
     - Generate compliance summaries for reporting and audits.

### 3. **Document Parser Tool**
   - **File**: `document_parser_tool.py`
   - **Purpose**: Extracts meaningful content from various document formats for further processing in workflows.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
     - Extracts metadata and splits content into manageable chunks.
     - Prepares documents for compliance checks or approvals.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Automated Approval Workflows**
   The `ApprovalPipelineTool` can be integrated into complex workflows to ensure that tasks requiring approval are routed, tracked, and logged automatically.

### 2. **Compliance Validation**
   With the `ComplianceCheckerTool`, workflows can validate outputs or actions against a set of predefined rules, ensuring adherence to organizational or legal requirements.

### 3. **Document Processing**
   The `DocumentParserTool` streamlines the ingestion of large volumes of documents, preparing their contents for compliance validation or further analysis.

## Integration Examples

### LangChain Workflow Integration

The tools in this module are designed to integrate seamlessly with LangChain workflows. For example:

```python
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
from langchain_tools.tools.workflow.approval_pipeline_tool import ApprovalPipelineTool

approval_tool = ApprovalPipelineTool()

# Define a workflow
workflow = SequentialChain(chains=[approval_tool.build_pipeline()])
workflow.run(input_data={"task_id": "12345", "approver": "manager@company.com"})
```

### Custom Compliance Rule Check

```python
from langchain_tools.tools.workflow.compliance_checker_tool import ComplianceCheckerTool

compliance_tool = ComplianceCheckerTool()
logs = [{"workflow_id": "wf-001", "status": "completed", "timestamp": "2025-01-25"}]
rules = [{"type": "status", "value": "completed"}]

report = compliance_tool.check_compliance(logs, rules)
print("Compliance Report:", report)
```

## Extensibility

This module is designed to be extensible:
- **New Tools**: Easily add new tools for specific workflow requirements.
- **Custom Pipelines**: Configure tools to fit unique organizational workflows.
- **API Integration**: Leverage these tools via backend API endpoints for automation.
