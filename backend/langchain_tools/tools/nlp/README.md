# NLP Tools

The `nlp` directory contains tools for performing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks as part of the LangChain-based system. These tools integrate with various APIs and libraries to provide functionality for analyzing and summarizing text.

---

## Tools Overview

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis Tool**
   - **File**: `sentiment_analysis_tool.py`
   - **Description**: Analyzes the sentiment of a given text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Features**:
     - Supports multiple APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT and custom sentiment analysis models).
     - Provides detailed sentiment scores and labels.

   **Usage Example**:
   ```python
   from sentiment_analysis_tool import SentimentAnalysisTool

   tool = SentimentAnalysisTool(openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")
   result = tool.analyze_sentiment("I love using this tool!")
   print(result)
   ```

---

### 2. **Text Summary Tool**
   - **File**: `text_summary_tool.py`
   - **Description**: Summarizes large texts into concise versions while preserving key information.
   - **Features**:
     - Utilizes OpenAI GPT or custom NLP models for text summarization.
     - Handles single and batch text summaries.
     - Configurable maximum length for summaries.

   **Usage Example**:
   ```python
   from text_summary_tool import TextSummaryTool

   tool = TextSummaryTool(openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")
   summary = tool.summarize_openai("This is a long text that needs summarization.", max_length=50)
   print(summary)
   ```

---

## Installation

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- `openai` for integration with OpenAI GPT models.
- Other custom NLP libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, if required).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai
# Add other dependencies as needed
```

## How to Use

Each tool is designed to be modular and can be directly imported into other parts of the system. They can be used in standalone scripts or integrated into LangChain workflows.

### Example Workflow Integration

```python
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
from nlp.sentiment_analysis_tool import SentimentAnalysisTool
from nlp.text_summary_tool import TextSummaryTool

# Initialize tools
sentiment_tool = SentimentAnalysisTool(openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")
summary_tool = TextSummaryTool(openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Example workflow
text = "This is a sample text for analysis and summarization."
sentiment = sentiment_tool.analyze_sentiment(text)
summary = summary_tool.summarize_openai(text, max_length=50)

print("Sentiment:", sentiment)
print("Summary:", summary)
```

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for real-time NLP pipelines using WebSocket APIs.
- Expand compatibility with multilingual models for both sentiment analysis and text summarization.
- Introduce more advanced NLP tools like topic modeling, keyword extraction, and named entity recognition (NER).

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute additional NLP tools or improve the existing ones. Ensure all tools follow the modular design pattern and are compatible with the LangChain framework.
