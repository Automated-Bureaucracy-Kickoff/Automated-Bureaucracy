# **Workflow Guide**

## **Overview**
The Automated Bureaucracy system provides a robust workflow management framework that supports task orchestration, agent collaboration, and compliance monitoring. This document outlines the structure, implementation, and best practices for creating, managing, and optimizing workflows within the system.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Dynamic Workflow Creation**:
   - Build workflows dynamically using agents and tools.
2. **Workflow Monitoring**:
   - Track workflow execution in real-time and detect bottlenecks.
3. **Collaboration Support**:
   - Enable multi-agent collaboration for complex workflows.
4. **Rule-Based Execution**:
   - Define compliance rules to ensure workflows adhere to organizational policies.
5. **Extensibility**:
   - Easily integrate custom tasks and tools.

---

## **Workflow Lifecycle**

### **1. Workflow Initialization**
- A workflow is initiated by specifying tasks, participating agents, and execution order.
- Tasks can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

**Example API Request**:
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "Data Processing Pipeline",
  "tasks": [
    {"name": "Task A", "agent": "Agent1", "parameters": {"data": "input.csv"}},
    {"name": "Task B", "agent": "Agent2", "parameters": {"summary": true}}
  ],
  "execution_mode": "sequential"
}
```

---

### **2. Task Execution**
- Each task in the workflow is executed by an assigned agent.
- Agents leverage LangChain for task orchestration and tool integration.

**Execution Modes**:
- **Sequential**: Tasks are executed one after another.
- **Parallel**: Tasks are executed concurrently, where possible.

---

### **3. Monitoring and Logging**
- Workflow activities are logged to ensure traceability and compliance.
- Logs include:
  - Task start and completion timestamps.
  - Agent actions and outputs.
  - Detected bottlenecks or compliance violations.

---

### **4. Compliance Verification**
- Compliance rules are applied to workflow logs to detect violations.
- Example rules:
  - **Time Limit**: Ensure tasks complete within the allotted time.
  - **Sequence Adherence**: Ensure tasks follow the predefined order.

---

### **5. Visualization and Reporting**
- Workflow progress and bottlenecks are visualized in the frontend.
- Compliance reports summarize adherence to rules.

**Example Visualization**:
- **Task Timeline**: Displays task execution order and duration.
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Highlights tasks exceeding the time threshold.

## **Core API Endpoints**

### **1. Create Workflow**
**POST** `/workflows/create`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "Example Workflow",
  "tasks": [
    {"name": "Collect Data", "agent": "Agent1"},
    {"name": "Analyze Data", "agent": "Agent2"}
  ],
  "execution_mode": "sequential"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Workflow created successfully",
  "workflow_id": "workflow_123"
}
```

---

### **2. Start Workflow**
**POST** `/workflows/{workflow_id}/start`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Workflow started successfully"
}
```

---

### **3. Monitor Workflow**
**GET** `/workflows/{workflow_id}/monitor`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "workflow_123",
  "status": "In Progress",
  "tasks": [
    {"name": "Task A", "status": "Completed"},
    {"name": "Task B", "status": "Pending"}
  ]
}
```

---

### **4. Generate Workflow Report**
**POST** `/workflows/{workflow_id}/report`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "workflow_123",
  "report": {
    "compliance": "Pass",
    "violations": []
  }
}
```

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Define Clear Task Dependencies**:
   - Use sequential execution for dependent tasks.
   - Use parallel execution for independent tasks to save time.
2. **Monitor Workflows in Real-Time**:
   - Leverage the Workflow Monitor to detect bottlenecks early.
3. **Ensure Compliance Rules Are Up-to-Date**:
   - Regularly update compliance rules to reflect changing organizational policies.

---

## **Advanced Features**

### **1. Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- Define tasks that require input or output sharing between agents.
- Use shared memory to synchronize agent states.

### **2. Dynamic Workflow Updates**
- Modify workflows during execution to accommodate changes in requirements.

### **3. AI-Powered Recommendations**
- Use AI to suggest optimizations based on historical workflow data.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Predictive Bottleneck Detection**:
   - Use machine learning to predict potential delays.
2. **Federated Workflow Execution**:
   - Enable workflows to span multiple systems or organizations.
3. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Integrate 3D visualization tools for complex workflows.
