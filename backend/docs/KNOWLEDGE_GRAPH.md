Here is the implementation for `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md`, a document outlining the usage and functionality of the Knowledge Graph in the Automated Bureaucracy system.

# **Knowledge Graph Documentation**

## **Overview**
The Knowledge Graph (KG) is a central component of the Automated Bureaucracy system, designed to store, manage, and query interconnected data across agents, workflows, and tasks. The KG enhances decision-making by maintaining a structured representation of relationships, dependencies, and insights.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Graph-Based Representation**:
   - Captures entities (e.g., agents, workflows, tasks) and their relationships.
2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Updates automatically based on agent activities and workflow changes.
3. **Query Interface**:
   - Provides a powerful query mechanism to extract actionable insights.
4. **Integration with LangChain**:
   - Utilizes LangChain tools for natural language querying and intelligent graph exploration.

---

## **Architecture**

### **1. Core Components**
- **Nodes**:
  - Represent entities like agents, tasks, workflows, and resources.
  - Example: `Agent1`, `Task A`, `Workflow_123`.
- **Edges**:
  - Represent relationships between nodes.
  - Example: `Agent1 -> executes -> Task A`.

### **2. Data Sources**
- Agent activity logs.
- Workflow execution logs.
- External APIs integrated with the system.

### **3. Storage**
- The Knowledge Graph is stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to facilitate fast querying and traversal.

### **4. Query Engine**
- Supports:
  - **Cypher Queries**: For advanced graph database interactions.
  - **LangChain Queries**: For natural language querying.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Data Ingestion**
- Data from agent logs, workflows, and external APIs are ingested and transformed into graph nodes and edges.
- Example:
  - **Input Log**:
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-01-25T10:00:00Z",
      "agent": "Agent1",
      "action": "executed_task",
      "task": "Task A"
    }
    ```
  - **Graph Update**:
    - Node: `Agent1`
    - Node: `Task A`
    - Edge: `Agent1 -> executes -> Task A`

### **2. Querying the Graph**
- **Example Cypher Query**:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (a:Agent)-[:executes]->(t:Task)
  WHERE a.name = "Agent1"
  RETURN t.name
  ```
- **LangChain Query**:
  - Natural language input: *"What tasks has Agent1 executed?"*

### **3. Visualization**
- Visualize the Knowledge Graph using tools like:
  - Neo4j Bloom.
  - Custom visualization components in the frontend.

---

## **Use Cases**

### **1. Workflow Optimization**
- Identify bottlenecks and dependencies by traversing workflow-related nodes.

### **2. Agent Insights**
- Query an agentâ€™s history to determine task performance and compliance.

### **3. Resource Allocation**
- Analyze relationships between resources and tasks to optimize allocation.

## **APIs for Knowledge Graph**

### **1. Add Node**
**POST** `/knowledge-graph/node`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "type": "Agent",
  "name": "Agent1",
  "properties": {
    "role": "task_executor"
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Node added successfully."
}
```

---

### **2. Add Edge**
**POST** `/knowledge-graph/edge`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "from": "Agent1",
  "to": "Task A",
  "relationship": "executes"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Edge added successfully."
}
```

---

### **3. Query Graph**
**GET** `/knowledge-graph/query`

**Request Parameters**:
- `query`: Cypher query string.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "task": "Task A"
    },
    {
      "task": "Task B"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Maintain Consistent Schema**:
   - Ensure all nodes and edges follow a standard format.
2. **Optimize Queries**:
   - Use indices in the graph database for frequently queried properties.
3. **Leverage Visualization**:
   - Use visual tools to understand complex relationships.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Automatic Ontology Generation**:
   - Dynamically build and update ontologies based on system activity.
2. **Federated Knowledge Graphs**:
   - Integrate multiple graphs across distributed systems.
3. **Enhanced Querying with AI**:
   - Improve natural language query capabilities with LangChain.
