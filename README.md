### Phase 1: MVP Development (3–6 Months)

**Objective:** Deliver a functional prototype with:

* Asynchronous Agent Communication (priority queues, topic filtering)
* Scalable Agent Interactions (3 agents: strategy, operations, ethics)
* Shared Memory System (knowledge graph or shared repository)
* Ethical Framework Module (basic safeguards)

**Milestones:**

* Build message passing interface
* Create agent prototypes
* Demo collaborative simulation
* Prove scalability to 10 agents

---

### Phase 2: Investor Engagement (Months 3–9)

**Objective:** Secure \$1M–\$3M seed funding.
**Tactics:**

* Pitch deck (applications, cost savings, ethics)

* Partnership outreach for pilot programs

---

### Phase 3: Scaling the Product (Months 9–18)

**Objective:** Expand simulation capacity and features.

* Modular framework for specific use cases
* Real-time adaptive feedback loops
* Configurable ethics engine
* Target sectors: logistics, finance, public administration

---

### Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Months 18–24)

**Objective:** Launch full product and secure paying clients.

* Partner with automation and AI firms
* Target \$2M ARR by end of Year 2

---

### Why Investors Should Care

* Large market potential across multiple industries
* Ethical, modular, first-mover advantage
* Designed for seamless scalability

---

### Immediate Next Steps

* Assemble MVP development team
* Build foundational tech stack (LangChain, cloud)
* Begin investor and pilot client outreach
