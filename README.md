## How To Run Frontend

If you don't have `npm` installed, first install Node.js, as `npm` comes bundled with it.  

### Install Node.js (which includes npm):

For Windows (via Chocolatey):  
```sh
choco install nodejs
```

For macOS (via Homebrew):  
```sh
brew install node
```

For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based):  
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

For Linux (Arch-based):  
```sh
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
```

Once Node.js is installed, proceed with running the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

## How To Run Backend

### For windows

```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python api_main.py  
```
### For mac
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python3 api_main.py
```

Draft Strategic Business Plan v1.0 for AutomatedBureaucracy.com

Vision
To revolutionize enterprise and public sector efficiency with a multi-agent collective intelligence framework that scales seamlessly while maintaining ethical oversight.

Core Goal
Build a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate the potential of multi-agent collective intelligence simulations, attract investors, and begin scaling.

Phase 1: MVP Development (3-6 Months)
Objective
Deliver a lightweight, functional prototype showcasing the simulation's core features:
Asynchronous Agent Communication: Implement a basic message-passing interface with priority queues and modular topic filtering.
Scalable Agent Interactions: Simulate at least three distinct agents (e.g., strategy, operations, ethics) working collaboratively on a task.
Shared Memory System: Introduce a minimal knowledge graph or shared data repository for collaborative learning.
Ethical Framework Module: Embed a simple, default safeguard for ethical compliance in agent decisions.
Key Milestones
Message Passing Interface: Develop a non-linear communication system to handle agent interactions.
Agent Prototypes: Create three role-specific agents (e.g., strategy, operations, ethics) using LangChain or a similar framework.
Simulation Demo: Showcase agents collaboratively solving a business problem (e.g., optimizing a supply chain or drafting a policy).
Scalability Proof: Demonstrate the ability to scale the system to at least ten agents in a test environment.

Phase 2: Investor Engagement (Months 3-9)
Objective
Secure funding by demonstrating MVP capabilities and market potential.
Tactics
Pitch Deck: Highlight the following:
Potential for enterprise and public sector applications.
Cost savings and efficiency gains through automation.
Ethical safeguards as a differentiator.
Investor Demonstrations: Use the MVP to showcase:
Asynchronous communication and collaboration between agents.
Scalability in handling complex, real-world scenarios.
Partnerships: Approach enterprise clients and public sector agencies for pilot programs.
Funding Ask
Initial seed funding: $1M-$3M to scale development and refine the product.

Phase 3: Scaling the Product (Months 9-18)
Objective
Expand the product to support larger simulations and increase functionality.
Development Priorities
Advanced Modular Framework:
Add plug-and-play modules for specific use cases (e.g., supply chain, compliance monitoring).
Real-Time Feedback Loops:
Enable agents to adapt dynamically based on emergent behaviors.
Enhanced Ethics Engine:
Introduce a configurable ethical framework for enterprise and public sector clients.
Market Strategy
Target enterprise clients in sectors like logistics, finance, and public administration.
Use success stories from pilot programs to attract larger clients.

Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Months 18-24)
Objective
Launch the fully functional product and secure paying clients.
Marketing Approach
Thought Leadership:
Publish white papers and case studies on collective intelligence in enterprise/public sectors.
Host webinars and workshops.
Sales Pipeline:
Partner with key players in automation, AI, and consulting industries to drive adoption.
Revenue Goals
Convert pilot programs into paid contracts within the first six months post-launch.
Aim for $2M ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) by the end of Year 2.

Why Investors Should Care
Market Potential: Multi-agent systems have massive applications in logistics, finance, public governance, and more.
First-Mover Advantage: An ethical, modular collective intelligence simulation framework is unique in the market.
Scalability: The system is designed to scale seamlessly across industries.

Immediate Next Steps
Recruit a small, skilled team to focus on MVP development (engineers, AI researchers, product managers).
Allocate resources for building the foundational tech stack (e.g., LangChain, cloud infrastructure).
Begin initial outreach to potential investors and pilot clients.
