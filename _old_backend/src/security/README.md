### `README.md` for `security` Module

## Security Module

The `security` module provides robust mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources, documents, and workflows within the Automated Bureaucracy system. It includes role-based access control (RBAC), document access management, and other critical security features.

---

### **Structure**

The `security` module consists of the following components:

1. **`document`**:
   - **`document_access_control.py`**: Handles permissions and restrictions for accessing documents within the system.
   - **`README.md`**: Documentation for the document access control module.

2. **`rbac_config.py`**:
   - Manages role-based access control (RBAC), defining roles, permissions, and user-role associations.

---

### **Features**

#### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Define Roles**: Create roles with specific permissions.
   - **Assign Roles**: Assign roles to users dynamically.
   - **Permission Check**: Validate whether a user has the required permission for an action.
   - **Audit**: Retrieve all roles, permissions, and user-role mappings.

#### 2. **Document Access Control**
   - Fine-grained access control to restrict or allow users to interact with specific documents.
   - Support for custom rules based on user roles, document sensitivity, and organizational policies.

#### 3. **Centralized Security**
   - All security-related configurations and utilities are centralized within this module for easy management and auditing.

### **Examples**

#### **RBAC Example**
```python
from security.rbac_config import RBACConfig

# Initialize RBAC
rbac = RBACConfig()

# Define roles and permissions
rbac.define_role("admin", ["manage_users", "access_sensitive_data"])
rbac.define_role("user", ["view_data", "edit_profile"])

# Assign roles to users
rbac.assign_role("user1", "admin")
rbac.assign_role("user2", "user")

# Check permissions
print(rbac.check_permission("user1", "manage_users"))  # True
print(rbac.check_permission("user2", "manage_users"))  # False
```

#### **Document Access Example**
```python
from security.document.document_access_control import DocumentAccessControl

# Initialize Document Access Control
dac = DocumentAccessControl()

# Grant access to a user for a document
dac.grant_access("doc123", "user1")

# Check access
print(dac.has_access("doc123", "user1"))  # True
print(dac.has_access("doc123", "user2"))  # False
```

---

### **Configuration**

Ensure the security module is configured in the main application pipeline to provide secure operations across agents, workflows, and document interactions.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

- **Audit Logs**: Implement detailed audit logs for all access attempts.
- **Encryption**: Add support for document encryption and decryption.
- **Dynamic Policies**: Allow dynamic policy updates based on external triggers or organizational needs.
