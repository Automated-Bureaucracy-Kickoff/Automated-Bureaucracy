# MLflow Integration

The `mlflow_integration` module provides utilities to manage and streamline machine learning experiment tracking, model fine-tuning, and artifact management using **MLflow**. It enables seamless integration with the MLflow Tracking Server and provides a set of tools for efficient model lifecycle management.

## Directory Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the `mlflow_integration` module.
- `mlflow_manager.py`: Handles high-level operations such as experiment creation, run management, and artifact logging.
- `model_fine_tuner.py`: Provides tools for fine-tuning machine learning models and logging results.
- `model_loader.py`: Loads pre-trained models or models logged in MLflow for inference or retraining.
- `tracking.py`: Handles detailed MLflow tracking operations, including experiment creation, run management, and logging metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the `mlflow_integration` module.

## Features

### 1. **Experiment Management**
The `mlflow_manager.py` and `tracking.py` modules allow you to:
- Create and manage experiments.
- Set up runs with custom tags and names.
- Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

### 2. **Model Fine-Tuning**
The `model_fine_tuner.py` module provides tools for:
- Fine-tuning models using hyperparameter sweeps.
- Logging the best model configurations and metrics for reproducibility.

### 3. **Model Loading**
The `model_loader.py` module supports:
- Loading models saved in MLflow.
- Retrieving model configurations for evaluation or further training.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install MLflow**:
   Ensure that MLflow is installed in your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install mlflow
   ```

2. **Set Up the MLflow Tracking Server**:
   Configure the tracking URI in your environment:
   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Dependencies**:
   Include any additional dependencies for the models you're fine-tuning or tracking.

## Usage

### Experiment Management
Create an experiment and start a run:
```python
from mlflow_integration.mlflow_manager import MLflowManager

mlflow_manager = MLflowManager()
mlflow_manager.set_experiment("My Experiment")
mlflow_manager.start_run("My Run")

mlflow_manager.log_metrics({"accuracy": 0.95, "loss": 0.1})
mlflow_manager.log_params({"learning_rate": 0.001, "batch_size": 32})

mlflow_manager.end_run()
```

### Model Fine-Tuning
Fine-tune a model and log the results:
```python
from mlflow_integration.model_fine_tuner import ModelFineTuner

fine_tuner = ModelFineTuner()
best_model = fine_tuner.fine_tune(data, params_grid)
fine_tuner.log_best_model(best_model)
```

### Model Loading
Load a pre-trained model:
```python
from mlflow_integration.model_loader import ModelLoader

model_loader = ModelLoader()
model = model_loader.load_model("My Experiment", "My Run")
```

---

## Tracking Operations
The `tracking.py` module provides granular control over MLflow operations, such as listing runs and retrieving experiment details:
```python
from mlflow_integration.tracking import TrackingManager

tracker = TrackingManager()
tracker.set_experiment("My Experiment")
run_id = tracker.start_run("Run Name")

tracker.log_metrics({"precision": 0.87, "recall": 0.92})
tracker.end_run()
```

---

## Best Practices

1. Use **descriptive experiment and run names** to make tracking easier.
2. Log **all relevant metrics and parameters** to enable reproducibility.
3. Use the `tracking.py` module for advanced tracking operations, such as listing experiments and retrieving run details.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with other experiment tracking tools.
- Enhanced hyperparameter optimization workflows.
- Support for distributed model training logs.
