# Authentication and Authorization Middleware

## Overview

The `auth` module in this middleware handles **authentication** and **authorization** for the system. It ensures secure access to resources by verifying user identities and enforcing role-based access controls.

---

## Features

### Authentication
- **Secure Login**: Validate user credentials using hashed passwords.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Generate and verify JWT tokens for session management.
- **Password Hashing**: Safely store user passwords using industry-standard hashing techniques (e.g., bcrypt).

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforce permissions based on user roles.
- **Permission Management**: Map roles to specific actions (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
- **Role Assignment**: Dynamically assign roles to users.

---

## File Descriptions

### `authentication.py`
Handles user authentication tasks:
- Validates user credentials.
- Hashes and verifies passwords.
- Generates JWT tokens for authenticated users.
- Decodes and validates tokens during requests.

### `authorization.py`
Manages user authorization:
- Verifies if a user has permissions to perform specific actions.
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC).
- Provides utility functions for role assignment and checking user roles.

### `README.md`
This documentation file, providing a detailed overview of the `auth` module and its components.

## How It Works

### Authentication Workflow
1. A user provides their credentials (username and password).
2. The `authentication.py` module:
   - Hashes the password using bcrypt during registration.
   - Verifies the provided password against the stored hash during login.
   - Generates a JWT token upon successful authentication.
3. The token is returned to the user and used for subsequent requests.

### Authorization Workflow
1. A user submits a request with their JWT token.
2. The `authorization.py` module:
   - Decodes the token to extract user role information.
   - Checks the role's permissions against the requested action.
3. Access is granted or denied based on the permissions.

## Example Usage

### Authentication Example
```python
from authentication import Authentication

# Hashing a password
hashed_password = Authentication.hash_password("my_secure_password")
print(f"Hashed Password: {hashed_password}")

# Verifying a password
is_valid = Authentication.verify_password("my_secure_password", hashed_password)
print(f"Password Valid: {is_valid}")

# Generating a JWT token
token = Authentication.create_token("user_id")
print(f"Generated Token: {token}")

# Verifying a JWT token
decoded_token = Authentication.verify_token(token)
print(f"Decoded Token: {decoded_token}")
```

### Authorization Example
```python
from authorization import Authorization

# Define roles and permissions
roles_permissions = {
    "admin": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
    "viewer": ["read"],
}

# Initialize the Authorization module
auth = Authorization(role_permissions=roles_permissions)

# Verify access for a role
token = Authentication.create_token("user_id", role="admin")
is_allowed = auth.verify_access(token, ["create", "delete"])
print(f"Access Allowed: {is_allowed}")

# Assign a new role to a user
user_db = {"user1": {"role": "viewer"}}
auth.assign_role_to_user("user1", "admin", user_db)
print(f"User Role: {user_db['user1']['role']}")
```

## Error Handling

### `AuthenticationError`
Raised when:
- Token validation fails.
- Password verification fails.

### `AuthorizationError`
Raised when:
- A user lacks the required permissions.
- Role information is missing or invalid.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Support for third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- **Session Management**: Implement refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.
- **Audit Logs**: Track authorization events for compliance and monitoring.
