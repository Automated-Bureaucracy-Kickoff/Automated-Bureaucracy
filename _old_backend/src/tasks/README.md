# Tasks Module

The `tasks` module provides functionality for managing and scheduling various system tasks, ensuring efficient execution and automation of workflows in the Automated Bureaucracy system.

## Overview

This module includes:
- **Compliance Jobs**: Tasks to ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulations.
- **Priority Task Queue**: A queue to manage tasks based on priority levels.
- **Reminders**: Tools for scheduling and sending reminders.
- **Task Scheduler**: A central scheduler for managing the execution of all tasks.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `compliance_job.py`
Handles compliance-related tasks by:
- Automatically validating agent activities.
- Generating reports to ensure adherence to compliance rules.
- Logging potential violations for further review.

### 2. `priority_task_queue.py`
Manages a prioritized queue of tasks by:
- Assigning priority levels to tasks.
- Ensuring higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.
- Supporting dynamic updates to task priorities.

### 3. `reminder_job.py`
Provides reminder functionality by:
- Scheduling reminders based on specific timestamps.
- Sending notifications via integrated channels (email, API, etc.).
- Managing recurring reminders for repeated tasks.

### 4. `task_scheduler.py`
A centralized task scheduler that:
- Uses a `PriorityQueue` for efficient task management.
- Allows scheduling tasks at specific times.
- Processes and executes tasks in the background.
- Logs all task-related events for debugging and monitoring.

## Features

- **Efficient Scheduling**: The `task_scheduler.py` uses a thread-safe `PriorityQueue` to execute tasks based on their execution time.
- **Dynamic Priority Management**: Tasks in the `priority_task_queue.py` can have their priority updated dynamically.
- **Automated Compliance**: The `compliance_job.py` ensures agent and workflow activities adhere to predefined rules.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: The `reminder_job.py` supports scheduling and delivering reminders for time-sensitive tasks.

## Usage

### Adding a Compliance Job
```python
from compliance_job import ComplianceJob

job = ComplianceJob()
job.run_compliance_check(agent_logs, compliance_rules)
```

### Scheduling a Task
```python
from task_scheduler import TaskScheduler
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def example_task():
    print("Task executed!")

scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.add_task(
    execute_time=datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10),
    task_func=example_task,
    task_name="Example Task"
)
scheduler.start()
```

### Managing Priority Queue
```python
from priority_task_queue import PriorityTaskQueue

queue = PriorityTaskQueue()
queue.add_task(task_name="High Priority Task", priority=1)
queue.add_task(task_name="Low Priority Task", priority=5)
queue.execute_next()
```

## Extensibility

- **Custom Task Types**: New task types can be created by extending the `ScheduledTask` class in `task_scheduler.py`.
- **Integration with Services**: The module is designed to integrate seamlessly with services like compliance monitoring and workflow automation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the coding standards outlined in the project documentation.
- Ensure tasks are thread-safe and can handle concurrent execution.
- Write unit tests for all new functionality.

## Future Improvements

- Support for distributed task execution across multiple nodes.
- Enhanced logging with detailed metrics for task execution times.
- Integration with external task management tools (e.g., Celery, Airflow).
