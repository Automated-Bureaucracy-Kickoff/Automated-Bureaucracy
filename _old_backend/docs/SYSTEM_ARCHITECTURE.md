# **System Architecture Documentation**

## **Overview**
The Automated Bureaucracy system is a modular, scalable platform designed to simulate and manage collective intelligence workflows. It combines modern software paradigms like microservices, event-driven architecture, and AI/ML integration to provide robust automation and analysis.

---

## **High-Level Architecture**
### **1. Layers of the System**
The architecture consists of three primary layers:
1. **Frontend (React)**:
   - A dynamic web interface for managing agents, workflows, and compliance.
2. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
   - API layer that handles agent operations, workflow orchestration, and analytics.
3. **Storage and Data Management**:
   - Persistent data storage using PostgreSQL.
   - Graph-based storage for the knowledge graph (Neo4j).
   - Model and experiment tracking with MLflow.

### **2. Communication Flow**
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
- Agents interact with external APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Tavily) for task execution.
- Compliance, analytics, and workflow monitoring modules operate asynchronously using an event-driven system (Redis as a message broker).

---

## **Core Components**

### **1. Frontend**
- **Technology**: React with TypeScript.
- **Features**:
  - Agent management dashboard.
  - Workflow monitoring in real-time.
  - Customizable visualizations for simulations.
- **Key Modules**:
  - `AgentDashboard`: Displays the status and configuration of agents.
  - `WorkflowMonitor`: Tracks workflow execution and bottlenecks.
  - `ComplianceViewer`: Summarizes compliance reports.

---

### **2. Backend**
- **Technology**: FastAPI.
- **Features**:
  - API endpoints for managing agents, workflows, and analytics.
  - LangChain integration for agent orchestration and natural language queries.
  - Workflow logging and compliance monitoring.
- **Key Modules**:
  - **`agents/`**: Implements agent lifecycle and task management.
  - **`analytics/`**: Provides compliance reporting and visualization.
  - **`api_integration/`**: Integrates with external APIs like OpenAI and Tavily.
  - **`cli/`**: Command-line tools for managing the system.
  - **`config/`**: Stores system configuration and secrets.

---

### **3. Storage and Data Management**
- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**:
  - Stores agent logs, workflow states, and configuration.
- **Graph Database (Neo4j)**:
  - Maintains the knowledge graph for entity relationships and workflow dependencies.
- **Experiment Tracking (MLflow)**:
  - Tracks model performance and metadata.

---

### **4. Workflow and Task Orchestration**
- **LangChain**:
  - Manages sequential and parallel execution of tasks.
  - Provides memory for context retention across workflows.
- **Workflow Monitor**:
  - Detects bottlenecks and monitors task status.
- **Task Tools**:
  - Reflection tool (notepad).
  - Internet search tool (Tavily).

---

### **5. Event-Driven System**
- **Redis**:
  - Used as a message broker for real-time event handling.
  - Enables asynchronous processing for workflow logging and compliance checks.

---

## **Integration with External APIs**
1. **OpenAI API**:
   - Provides language model capabilities for agents.
2. **Tavily API**:
   - Facilitates web searches for real-time data.
3. **Neo4j**:
   - Hosts the knowledge graph.
4. **MLflow**:
   - Tracks model versions and metrics.

---

## **Scalability and Deployment**
### **1. Containerization**
- **Docker**:
  - All components are containerized for portability and consistency.
- **Docker Compose**:
  - Orchestrates multi-container setups.

### **2. Cloud Deployment**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
  - Compute: GKE for Kubernetes-based deployment.
  - Storage: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL and Cloud Storage for artifacts.
  - MLflow and Neo4j hosted on managed instances.

---

## **Detailed Module Interactions**
### **1. Agent Workflow**
1. User creates an agent via the frontend or CLI.
2. Backend initializes the agent using LangChain and tools.
3. Agent performs tasks and logs activities in the database.
4. Workflow Monitor tracks task progress and detects bottlenecks.

### **2. Compliance Monitoring**
1. Agent logs are ingested by the compliance module.
2. Rules are applied to detect violations.
3. Compliance reports are generated and visualized in the frontend.

### **3. Knowledge Graph**
1. Agent activities update the graph with new nodes and edges.
2. Queries retrieve insights about relationships and dependencies.
3. Graph visualizations are rendered in the frontend.

---

## **Security Considerations**
1. **Authentication**:
   - API keys are stored securely in `secrets.json`.
2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive operations.
3. **Data Encryption**:
   - SSL/TLS for all network communications.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Federated Workflows**:
   - Support cross-system workflows with distributed agents.
2. **Real-Time Dashboards**:
   - Implement WebSocket-based updates for compliance and workflow monitoring.
3. **AI-Driven Insights**:
   - Use machine learning to identify inefficiencies in workflows and suggest optimizations.
